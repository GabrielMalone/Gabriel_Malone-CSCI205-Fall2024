Open map has the function 'put_with_linear_probe' but it has quadratic probe logic. 
It's a pain to go back and set up both quad and linear since all the functions need to be changed to accomodate whichever 
type of probing is being used, so im leaving in the quadratic probing since it's the most effective. 

The pdfs address the differences in linear and quadratic probing results.
