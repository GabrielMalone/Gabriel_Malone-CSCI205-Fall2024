‘Or break it,’ said Elrond. ‘Look not too far ahead! But go
now with good hearts! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves
and Men and all Free Folk go with you. May the stars shine
upon your faces!’
‘Good ... good luck!’ cried Bilbo, stuttering with the cold.
‘I don’t suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my
lad, but I shall expect a full account when you get back. And
don’t be too long! Farewell!’
Many others of Elrond’s household stood in the shadows
and watched them go, bidding them farewell with soft voices.
There was no laughter, and no song or music. At last they
turned away and faded silently into the dusk.
They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long
steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and
they came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed
through the heather. Then with one glance at the Last
Homely House twinkling below them they strode away far
into the night.
